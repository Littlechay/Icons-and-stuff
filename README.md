# Icons-and-stuff

This repo contains a few customisation files that I have put together for the AvNav project. 

The first file  AISIcons.zip contains AIS icons of different colours. Its purpose is to colcour code various categories of ship, tug, fishing, tanker, etc.. This makes it easier to understand how a target may behave and improves situational awareness. The images.json file shoudl be uploaded to the User foder, in AvNav, (or edited into your own version of the file) and the *.png images need go in the Images folder.


markicons.zip contains all the waypoint icons from OpenCPN. The file should be uploaded into the Layers folder if you want to import .gpx files from OpenCPN so that waypoints will display with the correct icons.
